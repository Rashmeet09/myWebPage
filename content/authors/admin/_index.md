I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science advised by [Dr. Siddharth Srivastava](https://www.public.asu.edu/~ssriva43/) in the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I'm a member of the [Autonomous Agents and Intelligent Robots (AAIR)](https://aair-lab.github.io/) research group. I primarily research key Artificial Intelligence principles to help build efficient autonomous sequential decision-making systems. My current research focuses on synthesizing abstractions for transfer in planning and reinforcement learning.
