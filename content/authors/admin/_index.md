I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/), where I work with [Dr. Siddharth Srivastava](https://www.public.asu.edu/~ssriva43/) in the [School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence](https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/). I'm part of the [Autonomous Agents and Intelligent Robots (AAIR)](https://aair-lab.github.io/) research group. My research primarily centers on Reinforcement Learning (RL), with a focus on developing more sample-efficient and scalable autonomous sequential decision-making systems, particularly for long-horizon tasks. Currently, I am investigating the autonomous invention of temporal and state abstractions and the integration of planning with RL to improve generalization and transfer in RL.
