I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I am a member of the [Autonomous Agents and Intelligent Robots (AAIR)](https://aair-lab.github.io/) research group, advised by [Dr. Siddharth Srivastava](https://www.public.asu.edu/~ssriva43/). I research key Artificial Intelligence principles to help build efficient systems that can reason about, plan, and act under uncertainty.
